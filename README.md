This project showcases a web form designed to capture lead information and submit it directly to Salesforce using the Salesforce Web-to-Lead feature. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the form enables users to input lead details such as first name, last name, company, email, and lead date. Validation ensures required fields are filled, and date formatting aligns with Salesforce standards. Integration with Google reCAPTCHA prevents spam submissions, while automatic timestamp generation aids reCAPTCHA verification. Simply clone the repository, open index.html, fill out the form, verify reCAPTCHA, and submit to seamlessly add leads to Salesforce.
